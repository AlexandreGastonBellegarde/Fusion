TODO for CPU version of PBD
- reread the PBD paper to understand how it works
- figure out how Unity winds its vertices
- import the PBD class structure into Unity
- look into the official PBD implementation to steal some designs

TODO for usability
- use a quad to represent the cloth size, then specify a size and generate
    a cloth mesh on the fly to replace the quad
- duplicate the cloth mesh and reverse normals for double sided shading
